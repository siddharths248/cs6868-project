    applies the operation represented by [invoc] to the object [new_obj] in the universal construction instance [lfu_obj] *)
(*new_obj is a newly constructed object*)
(*invoc is a partially applied function. Its only missing argument is the object. 
It returns a new object of the same type after applying the function *)
